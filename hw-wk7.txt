Part 2:

1. It was first introduced by Apple for use in their Mac OS X
WebKit component in the year 2004.

2. Canvas 2D provide a way to draw graphics with Javascript. 2D stands for two-dimensional.

3. The canvas element is defined by “<canvas></canvas>”,
which is added to the index.html file

4. The other elements are width and height

5. The default canvas size is 300w and 150h

6. Nothing will render.

7. The canvas would render 300w and 150h

8. A context would need to be created in order to gain access to the actual drawing interface. A context is an object whose methods provide the drawing interface.

9. 
- 2d for 2 dimensional graphics
- webgl for 3 dimensional graphics 

10. We can access our drawing context using the HTL5 built-in method .getContext() const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");

11. The two primitive shapes supported are Rectangles and paths

12. Other shapes are created by combining shapes. Built in canvas-path functions help create complex shapes

13. 
- fillRect() - fillRect(x, y, width, height)
  x- the x-axis coordinate of the upper left corner of rectangle
  y- the y-axis of the upper left corner of rectangle
  width: rectangle's width. positive values on the right. negative values on the left
  height: rectangle's height. positive values are down. negative values are down

- strokeRect() - ctx.strokeRect(x, y,width,height)
  x- the x-axis coordinate rectangle start point. 
  y- the y-axis  coordinate rectangle start point. 
  width: rectangle's width. positive values on the right. negative values on the left
  height: rectangle's height. positive values are down. negative values are up

- clearRect() - ctx.clearRect(x, y,width,height)
  x- the x-axis coordinate rectangle start point. 
  y- the y-axis  coordinate rectangle start point. 
  width: rectangle's width. positive values on the right. negative values on the left
  height: rectangle's height. positive values are down. negative values are up

14. a list of points connected by segments of lines that can be various shapes. They can be curved with different widths and colors. 

15. 
- draw a path.
- Use drawing commands to draw into the path.
- once a path has been created, use stroke ( ) or fill ( ) to
the path to render the drawing
